## About me

Hi ! I'm a post-doc researcher in the GRETTIA team at Gustave Eiffel University. My research interests focus on developing machine learning and statistical modeling applied on mobility data (mobile phone, smart cards, counts data, etc.). I am interested in the analysis/prediction of data using pre-existing methods or methods yet to be implemented, in a variety of fields such as transport, biology, meteorology, etc..
