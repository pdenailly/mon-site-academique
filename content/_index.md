        I am currently working on [MobiTIC ANR project](https://anr.fr/Project-ANR-19-CE22-0010) with the aim of inferring the multimodal mobility of people in the RhÃ´nes-Alpes region using statistical learning models and the fusion of multiple data sources.

        I try to apply/improve a range of qualitative and quantitative methods to comprehensively investigate people's mobilities.
